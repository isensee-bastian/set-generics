# Generics Part 3: Set Implementation with Generics
* Why use generics
    * Allows code reuse
    * Allows restrictions on types that the compiler can verify
* Using generics
    * Defining generic types and functions
    * Using generic types and functions
    * Disadvantage: Complexity increases (readability)
